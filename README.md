# World_Weather_Analysis

Purpose: This repository contains Python code to create a map using gmaps and adds markers and layers to the map to create a route between various cities.  The markers contain information on hotels within a buffer from the cities and the weather conditions, so one can easily identify where to stay if they are taking a trip.
